Python Mini Project
1.	A degree of freedom in functionality. X
2.	Use iteration and conditionals to create an ongoing program. X 
3.	Capable of executing a different output dependent on user input. X
4.	Create a program that continues until the user exits the program. X
5.	User should be able to choose from several options and each should cause the program to execute a different task. X
6.	The final option should exit the program. X
7.	These tasks can be whatever you like .i.e. print something to the terminal, making calculations. 
8.	Python Visual studio code X
9.	Push to GitHub X
10.	Create a flowchart (draw.io, export and download as a png) X
11.	ReadMe document (describe what you did) X 



The thought behind this project was to ensure I had good functionality i.e. the menu I created.

The flowchart I built aided me visually but I had to change this a couple of times in order to get the layout as clear as possible. 

Thinking and Changing my mind during coding was the reason for editing the flowcharts.

I used a while loop because a while loop is infinite which fits in nicely with adding a break in order to exit the program.

I chose 99 as the figure to exit the program because no strings were allowed in int(input()) which read in from the keyboard.

I used a few if statements, elifs and elses. Identation was tricky to get used to.
