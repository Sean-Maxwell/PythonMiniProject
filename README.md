# PythonMiniProject

The thought behind this project was to ensure I had good functionality i.e. the menu I created.

The flowchart I built aided me visually but I had to change this a couple of times in order to get the layout as clear as possible. 

Thinking and Changing my mind during coding was the reason for editing the flowcharts.

I used a while loop because a while loop is infinite which fits in nicely with adding a break in order to exit the program.

I chose 99 as the figure to exit the program because no strings were allowed in int(input()) which read in from the keyboard.

I used a few if statements, elifs and elses. Identation was tricky to get used to.
